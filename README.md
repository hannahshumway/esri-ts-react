## Notes

### Controlled vs Uncontrolled components

updates:  
* Controlled components update on every interaction (keypress, click, etc.)
* Uncontrolled components update when you tell them to (they need code to say WHEN they should update)

re-render:  
* Controlled component provoke re-rendering on every update because they're tied to state
* Uncontrolled components may not even provoke re-rendering

external updates:  
* Controlled components can reflect updates to data other than from the form field
* Uncontrolled components cannot reflect updates other than through user interactions (typing, clicking, etc.)

collecting data:  
* Controlled components are up-to-date
* Data from uncontrolled components may be stale
